<ul>
<li> Major upgrade of the security model: backends are now protected even on multi-user systems.
<li> Add public server option so that you can access Beaker over the internet, not just locally.  Includes HTTPS encryption.
<li> Refactor the Javascript to conform to Angular guidelines.
<li> Improve file load/save dialogs to be easier to use and handle errors.
<li> Shared notebooks can be downloaded from the resulting share page, and the sharing viewer can open a notebook file hosted anywhere.
<li> On Mac, add a native application to wrap and launch the web app.  The native app includes the JRE, eliminating an external dependency for users.
<li> On Windows, include the JRE, nginx, and python in our distribution.
<li> On Ubuntu, include a script to install all dependencies and language plugins.
