  "While Beakerâ€™s notebook-style development environment supports multiple languages, the shell itself has no native language of its own. In order to use Beaker, at least one programming language must be installed. So, to help get you started, Beaker will be installed with JavaScript and Groovy support, as well as HTML, Latex, and Markdown. After successfully setting up Beaker, you can then install any of the languages from the list below. A full set of install instructions are provided for each."

  In addition, we have published a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/beakernotebook/beaker/", target="_blank", onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Click', 'Link', 'docker']);">Docker
  container</a> with Beaker and all supported languages built right
  in.  If you can run containers, this is the fastest way to get started.
