  Great languages breed great ideas. This is why Beaker is architected
  to support multiple languages that can be plugged into its
  platform. Currently supported languages include Python, Python3, R, JavaScript, SQL,
  C++, Scala/Spark, Lua/Torch, Java, Julia, 
  Groovy, Node, Ruby, HTML, and Clojure. We
  encourage and welcome the addition of new language plugins. If
  you’re interested, please see our <a
  href="https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/How-to-Add-a-Language-to-Beaker" target="_blank">documentation wiki</a>.

  "If we could liken the traditional IDE to a multinational conglomerate, then Beaker is the agile startup. More dynamic, a notebook IDE is composed of multiple coding blocks, called cells. Individual cells can be run independently of others and contain different programming languages. The result is a flexible coding and prototyping environment, and a research experience that’s more like a symphony than a soliloquy."

  We want you to be able to use the right tool for the job, knowing
  all your tools will work in concert. This is why Beaker provides
  native <a href="https://pub.beakernotebook.com/publications/04ced174-fba9-11e5-b8c1-df4d629d60e2?fullscreen=true">autotranslation</a>
  that lets a developer declare specific variables in a cell in one
  language, then access these seamlessly in a different cell and
  language. Such capability frees developers to utilize those inherent
  strengths of the individual languages in pursuit of their research,
  without spending time dealing with intermediary files.

  In addition to those extensive charting libraries native to
  supported languages, Beaker offers a <a href="https://pub.beakernotebook.com/publications/3d73fc60-fb87-11e5-9022-8b109a182308?fullscreen=true">rich charting API</a> for Groovy,
  which can also be leveraged by other languages through a simple JSON
  interface. Not only does it produce beautiful, interactive charts
  but it also handles large datasets that would normally bring your
  browser to a halt. This <a href="https://pub.beakernotebook.com/publications/259cd302-fc3e-11e5-ad13-bff1c2ac4776?fullscreen=true">level-of-detail feature</a> dynamically
  resamples the data based on the zoom level and window size, to keep
  the frame rate high. Further support for <a href="https://pub.beakernotebook.com/publications/7fdcaaa6-fb83-11e5-9212-0797fdc961bc?fullscreen=true">D3</a> permits the
  visualization-savvy developer (perhaps not unlike yourself) to view
  data in unlimited ways.  Beaker also works with

p.block.
  You’ve created a notebook ripe with analysis, inline documentation,
  and compelling visualizations. Beaker then streamlines the process
  of sharing your work with friends and/or colleagues. We have a <a
  href="https://pub.beakernotebook.com/publications/featured">publication server</a> to host
  and display your work, including the ability to interact with its
  charts and tables.  You can upload and share your notebook with just
  one click!

p.block.
  Previous versions of Beaker had a sharing server that used Github
  gists to host the content.  This server has been deprecated.  It
  does not support all the new features of Beaker and eventually it
  will be shut down, though for now we will keep it (and the menu item
  that connects to it) working.

  You can also run Beaker with a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/beakernotebook/beaker/">Docker Container</a>.  Or

p.block.
  The ability to add descriptive text and other informative markup to
  code is of particular importance to researchers and data scientists
  alike. With Beaker you can use TeX for typeset mathematics,
  Markdown for easy formatting, and HTML for complete control.  You
  can even mix all of these formats in the <a href="https://pub.beakernotebook.com/publications/ca8b75fa-fb88-11e5-aa2e-ef3f9ace2aff?fullscreen=true">same paragraph</a>.

p.block.
  With this capability researchers can, for example, add inline
  notes and images describing their methodology, complex equations to
  help explain functionality, and rich formatting in the service of
  making their work more intelligible.

p.block.
  Furthermore, Beaker provides the ability to organize a notebook into
  hierarchical sections, each of which can be viewed, hidden, shared, or
  evaluated individually or as a whole. All in all, a very presentable
  package.
