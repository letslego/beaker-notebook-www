  "Great languages breed great ideas. This is why Beaker is architected to support multiple languages that can be plugged into its platform. Present supported languages include Python, R, Julia, Groovy, JavaScript, Node, Ruby, Scala, HTML, Markdown, and Latex. We encourage and welcome the addition of new language plugins. If you’re interested, please see our Evaluator Plugin documentation."

  "Notebooks Enable Iterative Exploration",
  "If we could liken the traditional IDE to a multinational conglomerate, then the notebook IDE would most certainly be the agile startup. More dynamic, a notebook IDE is composed of multiple coding blocks, called cells. Individual cells can be run independently of others and contain different programming languages. The result is a flexible coding and prototyping environment, and a research experience that’s more like a conversation than a monologue."

  "Translate Data Between Languages",
  "A notebook’s capacity to support multiple languages is a little lackluster if all these languages aren’t able to communicate with each other. We want you to be able to use the right tool for the job, knowing they will all work in concert. This is why Beaker provides native auto-translation that lets a developer declare specific variables in a cell through one language, then access these seamlessly in a different cell and language. Such capability frees developers to utilize those inherent strengths of the individual languages in pursuit of their research, without spending time dealing with intermediary files."

  "Rich Visualizations",
  "In addition to the extensive charting libraries native to the supported languages, Beaker offers a rich charting API for Groovy, which can also be leveraged by other languages through a simple JSON interface. Not only does it produce beautiful interactive charts, but it specifically handles large data sets that would normally bring your browser to its knees.  This level-of-detail feature dynamically resamples the data based on the zoom level and window size to keep the frame rate high.  Further support for D3 permits the visualization-savvy developer (perhaps not unlike yourself) to view data in unlimited ways. For those of you interested in writing your own visualization frameworks, Beaker also supports a pluggable Output Display allowing developers to write unique charting APIs or incorporate other, existing third party visualization libraries. In short, options abound. For more information on writing your own Output Display, check out our Output Display Plugin documentation."

  "Share Notebooks easily",
  "You’ve created a notebook ripe with analysis, inline documentation, and compelling visualizations. Beaker then streamlines the process of sharing your work with friends and/or colleagues. We provide a notebook viewer for rendering that notebook from any URL, as well as one-click action for saving your notebook to a GitHub Gist and generating a link for the viewer. Refer to our Example Notebooks section to see the forms publications can take."

  "Advanced markup",
  "The ability to add descriptive text and other informative markup to code is of particular importance to researchers and developers alike. So Beaker offers a variety of cells allowing for just that. These include Latex support, Markdown, and HTML. With this capability a researcher could, for example, add inline notes and images describing their methodology, complex equations to help explain functionality, and rich formatting in the service of making the work more intelligible. All in all, a very presentable package."
