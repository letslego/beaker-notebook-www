  "Beaker Vision",
  "Over the past decade, researchers at Two Sigma have migrated away from traditional IDEs toward a more conversational approach to big data research. This trend culminated in Beaker, a notebook-style development environment allowing researchers in various fields to interact with their data and build models more efficiently. Although Two Sigma is rooted in the world of finance, Beaker was created to be agnostic to the type of research being performed, thus an effective tool for various modes of analysis. "

  "Giving Back",
  "Two Sigma has and continues to use a great many open source products. As a result, our individual developers and the company want to give back to the open source community. While developers at Two Sigma regularly contribute as individuals to a host of open source projects, Beaker is the first release of one of our own home grown products in its entirety."
