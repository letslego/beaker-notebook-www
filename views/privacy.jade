    Two Sigma Beaker Privacy Policy
    Effective Date 21 April 2014 (last updated 21 April 2014)
  p.block.
    This Privacy Policy applies to our websites and platforms.
    This Policy describes how Two Sigma Open Source, LLC and its affiliates (“Two Sigma”, “We”, “we”, or “us”) treats personal information collected on the websites and platforms where this policy is located (each a “Site”), including from the Beaker software itself. This policy does not apply to information Two Sigma collects offline, through email, or through other sites. This policy also does not apply to websites or platforms where it is not posted and where a link to the privacy policy is not provided.
  p.block.
    We collect information from and about you.
    We collect contact information. For example, we might collect your name, company name, address, phone number, fax number, and email when you use or download our products and services, such as the Beaker software.
  p.block.
    We collect information using Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google. Google Analytics collects information such as how long you spend in Beaker, your browser information, and your geographic region. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of our Beaker software, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services and Two Sigma.
  p.block.
    We collect other information. We may collect usage data on how you use our products and services. This may include the programming language used for each Beaker cell you execute and what types of file formats you use when loading notebooks. We may also collect information about your browser. We may also collect your IP address. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.
  p.block.
    We collect information in different ways.
    We collect information directly from you. For example, if you register with us or download our products online.
  p.block.
    We collect information from you passively. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. Learn more about these tools and how you can control them, here. Third party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons through our Site (for example Google Analytics) to provide us with information about how you use and interact with our Site.
  p.block.
    We get information about you from third parties. For example, our business partners may give us information about you. We may combine this information with information you give us.
  p.block.
    We collect information as otherwise described at the time of collection.
  p.block.
    We use information as disclosed and described here.
    We use information to respond to your requests or questions. For example, we might use your information to confirm your download or use of our products.
  p.block.
    We use information to improve our products and services. We might use your information to customize your experience with us. We may do this by looking at site trends or user interests.
  p.block.
    We use information for security purposes. We may use information to protect our company, affiliates, our customers, or our website, or a third-party website or platform.
  p.block.
    We use information for marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about upgrades, special promotions or offers. These might include professional opportunities that we believe you may be interested in. These might be our own offers or products, or third party offers or products we think you might find interesting.
  p.block.
    We use information to communicate with you about our relationship. We may contact you about your use of our goods and services. We might also contact you about this Policy or our website Terms.
  p.block.
    We use information as otherwise described or permitted by law.
  p.block.
    We may share information with third parties.
    We will share information within the Two Sigma family of companies. This includes Two Sigma Investments, LLC.
  p.block.
    We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we share information with our vendors.
  p.block.
    We will share information with third parties on our website and other websites. For example, we may make anonymous usage information publicly available on our Site. Google may use the data collected through Google Analytics to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. For Google’s privacy policy see http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.
  p.block.
    We will share analytics and usage information with other parties. For example, we share aggregate anonymous usage data we obtain through Google Analytics and through our own analytics with third parties, including other users of the Beaker software and the Site.
  p.block.
    We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. We might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud.
  p.block.
    We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. For example, if part of our business was sold we may give your information as part of that transaction.
  p.block.
    We may share information for other reasons we may describe to you.
  p.block.

    You have certain choices about our marketing and tracking tools.
    You can opt out of receiving our marketing emails. To stop receiving our promotional emails, simply use the opt-out or unsubscribe method provided in emails you receive from us.
  p.block.
    You can control cookies and tracking tools. Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies. To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go here. Why? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings. If you block cookies on your browser, certain features on our sites may not work. Options you select are browser and device specific. And, if you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. You can also opt-out of our usage tracking, and opt-out of Google Analytics tracking, depending on where the tracking occurs. You can opt-out of our usage tracking and Google Analytics tracking, which occurs within the Beaker software, by going to “Settings” and toggling off “Track anonymous usage info,” or selecting “No, don’t track” whenever a dialog box provides you with such an option. To opt-out of Google Analytics tracking which occurs when you visit our website(s), please see the section below.
  p.block.
    You can control Google Analytics. Website visitors that don’t want their visit data reported by the Google Analytics JavaScript can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) to prohibit sending visit information to Google Analytics. Learn more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on does not prevent data or information from being sent to the website itself or in other ways to web analytics services.
  p.block.
    Do Not Track. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These features are not yet uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.
  p.block.
    Your California privacy rights.
    If you reside in California, you have the right to ask us one time each year if we have shared personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make a request, please send us an email, or write to us at the address listed below. Indicate in your letter that you are a California resident making a “Shine the Light” inquiry.
  p.block.

  p.block.
    We use standard security measures.
    The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our site or software will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this Policy. We also keep information as otherwise required by law or for internal compliance or record-keeping purposes.
  p.block.
    We may link to other sites or have third party services on our site we don’t control.
    If you click on a link to a third party site, you will be taken to websites we do not control. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of that website. Read the privacy policy of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for these third party sites.
